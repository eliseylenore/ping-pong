## Known Bugs

I was not able to append the results to a div in the HTML, since it was showing the line break code when I tried. Instead, I used the <pre> tag to show the code. This was problematic when it came to formatting the error message. In some screens, you may have to use a scroll bar within the page to view all of the error message.
